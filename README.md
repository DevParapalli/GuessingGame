# GuessingGame
A guessing game implementation in multiple languages.

## Introduction

This is a for _fun_ project I am doing. I aim to create the simple guessing game in as many languages as possible.  
Some languages will be compiled and some will be interpreted.
The code given here should never be used in any production context.

## Contribution

If you wish to add a language, Feel free to do so. Since the codebase is not of a paticular language, Make sure the code follows the most popular style guidelines for the language.  

Create a Folder with the most correct representation of the language's name in ASCII characters. All the related files to the program will stay in this folder. A `README.txt`(or `.md`) file with instructions to correctly operate the program should be included with the actual code. A `.gitignore` file containing build time files, the final built executable and non code files should be included.

A reference non code implimentation is given in `.not_code` folder
